## üöÄ **Non-Functional Requirements**
### 1. **Scalability**
- Modular architecture with load balancers for horizontal scaling.

### 2. **Security**
- Encrypt sensitive data and implement firewalls and rate limiting.

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

### 4. **Testing**
- Unit and integration tests using `pytest`.
- Automated API testing for endpoint reliability.
